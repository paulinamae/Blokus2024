class BlokusStub(BlokusBase):
    """
    Stub implementation of BlokusBase.

    This stub implementation behaves according to the following rules:

    - It only supports two players.
    - Only three of the 21 Blokus shapes are available:
      the one-square, two-square, and three-square straight pieces.
    - Players are allowed to place pieces in any position of the board
      they want, even if the piece collides with any squares of
      previously played pieces (squares of the new piece replace any
      conflicting ones).
    - Board positions are not validated. If a method is called with
      a position outside the board, it will likely cause an exception.
    - There is no consideration of start positions for a player's
      first move.
    - The constructor simulates two initial moves: placing
      Player 1's "1" piece in the top-left corner and
      Player 2's "2" piece in the bottom-right corner.
    - The game ends after six moves. The player, if any, who has a
      piece occupying the top-right corner of the board wins.
      Otherwise, the players tie.
    - The `remaining_shapes` method always says all three shapes remain.
    - The only shape that is considered available by `available_moves`
      is the one-square shape, and it is considered available everywhere
      on the board regardless of whether the corresponding positions are
      available or occupied.
    - Several methods return simple, unhelpful results (as opposed to
      raising NotImplementedErrors).
